1. Refactor code so that positions comes from an external file
2. Refactor code so that the players data comes from an external file
3. Figure out how to check both primary and secondary positions in determing the All Time Starting Five
4. Figure out how to prevent a player from appearing on the All Time Starting Five at multiple positions - i.e. if LeBron has the highest PER, he'll be a starter at both his primary and secondary position
5. Figure out how to display the correct position based on which position they are actually in - i.e. LeBron has the highest PER for SF and PF, but when you are sorting by PF he appears but his position still shows "SF"
6. Add concurrently
7. Figure out formula for modifying total score
8. Add MongoDB database
